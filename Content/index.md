# Hi, Iâ€™m <span id="highlight">Cameron Bardell.</span>
## I make mobile apps and websites that people want to use.

I'm available to hire starting in April 2021, or to freelance anytime. 
You can contact me at <span id="highlight">cambardell3@gmail.com</span>, on [twitter](https://twitter.com/cameronbardell), or check out my GitHub [here](https://github.com/cambardell).
I have more than five years of experience making apps with Swift and UIKit. 
Recently, I've been using SwiftUI to create beautifully animated user interfaces.
I also have experience in data analysis with Python, Numpy, and Matplotlib, and create clean, readable websites with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap. This site was made using [Publish](https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish), a static site generator for Swift developers, and the source code is [here](https://github.com/cambardell/portfolio).
